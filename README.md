## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
    The MPG is predicted by this dataset, in particular the ground clearance and vehicle length provides the highest non random variance to the MPG values, as can be seen the picture below, they are well below 0.001. 
    The p value is 5.35e-11, which is much smaller than the significance level of 0.05 which means there is enough evidence our null hypothesis, which means that the slope of the linear model is not zero.
    The r-squared value is 0.7149, which means we can predict the MPG of the models around 71% of the time, which is pretty effective for our model.
### Purpose
    The purpose is to determine if there are any stocks that would be good investments based on their return rates for their past performances. As well as pros and cons of refactoring the VBA code to reduce the runtime of the script used to calculate the stock performances.
